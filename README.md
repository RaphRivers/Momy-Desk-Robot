### Key Features
#### 1. Advanced Vision
The integrated camera allows Momy to perceive and interpret the surrounding environment, opening the door to a range of applications, including facial recognition.

#### 2. Active Listening
With the integrated microphone, Momy can listen and understand audio inputs. This feature not only enables vocal interaction with the robot but also opens the door to voice recognition applications.

#### 3. Sound Response
The built-in speaker not only allows Momy to respond vocally but also provides the ability to produce a variety of sounds to enrich the interactive experience.

#### 4. Visual Feedback
The built-in screen provides visual feedback to the user, allowing Momy to communicate effectively through text, graphics, and more.

#### 5. Intelligent Mobility
Momy can move various parts of its body, ensuring a dynamic and interactive physical presence.

#### 6. Environmental Monitoring
An integrated thermometer measures internal temperature and humidity, offering an additional dimension of environmental awareness and eliminating the possibility of damage caused by high temperatures or excessive humidity. In such cases, the robot enters protection mode and notifies the user of the issue.

#### 7. Optimized Power System
Internal batteries enable Momy to operate wirelessly, with a recharge management module for added convenience.

#### 8. Remote Control with ESP32S3
Using ESP32S3, Momy can be remotely controlled, browse the Internet, and handle complex tasks such as audio-to-text conversion.

### Future Development Possibilities
The Momy project is open to further developments. Some possible extensions include integration with voice assistants like Alexa, sending camera images to a server for facial recognition, and many more.
